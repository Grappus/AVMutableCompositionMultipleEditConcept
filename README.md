# This is not a library or any third party helper class.
# This is intended to explain you the concept of multiple edits that you can make with AVMutableComposition class.
# There are 3 options in this demo project:change speed,done,change url.

# The "change speed" option doubles the speed of the video and plays the preview.
# The "done" option exports the video.Also the url gets updated.
#If you try to change the speed of the video multiple times without exporting,it will not be played properly.
#So you need to export a video before you can edit it again.You can watch the preview without exporting.But,to again perform a new edit option,you need to edit it.
